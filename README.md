Here's where I'll work on implementations of algorithms used in number theory, before iteratively optimising them!

Currently, these include:

- Sieve of Eratosthenes (utilising numpy arrays to yield a time complexity of 'O(n log log n)')

- Sieve of Atkin (yielding a time complexity of 'O(n / log log n)')

- Sieve of Sundaram (yielding a time complexity of 'O(n log n)')

- Primality Checker
